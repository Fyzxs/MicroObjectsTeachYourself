# MicroObjectsTeachYourself
Multiple projects showing evolution of code with microObjects practices applied.

For the course of this, MicroObjects can be simply defined as "One behavior per object".

## Add Two Ints
The first of the Teach Yourself MicroObjects examples.

The Requirement: Add two ints
The Goal: Have a final implementation in MicroObjects.

Threre is a step by step commit history of how behavior can be extracted to form MicroObjects.
This project lays a few foundational pieces and concepts that are going to be built on in future projects.
