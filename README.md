# MicroObjectsTeachYourself
Multiple projects showing evolution of code with microObjects practices applied.

For the course of this, MicroObjects can (usually) be simply defined as "One behavior per object".

There is a step by step commit history of how behavior can be extracted to form MicroObjects.

## Add Two Ints
The first of the Teach Yourself MicroObjects examples.

The Requirement: Add two ints
The Goal: Have a final implementation in MicroObjects.

This project lays a few foundational pieces and concepts that are going to be built on in future projects.

## Display Data
Display data without violating encapsulation

The Requirement: Display (to the test output window) the value of an Integer without a getter.
The Goal: Integer has 100% test coverage.

A big question with "No Getters" is, "How do you get data out to display?". It's a great question.

I hold that encapsulation is the most critical principle to having maintainable code. If you violate encapsulation you reduce the maintainability of the code.
Maintaining encapsulation means you can't return the data you hold. So, Yes - How can you display it?
